# If IFTTT.com gets a 404 on a "download image" trigger, it instead saves a custom "couldn't find that" image,
#Â This is bullshit, so this script finds those and nukes them from orbit by looking for files with the right
# Checksum, and then deleting them. MD5 is not cryptographically secure, but if somehow something manages to
# generate an md5 with the same value as their 404, by accident or malice, it deserves to be sent to the 
# phantom zone. Don't run this on / just in case, though. 
#
# This program deletes files. No warrenty is entered into. Caveat Clicktor.

# Find files | Get the MD5 for each | Filter for this checksum | delete all the things. Now with added Array Technology!
